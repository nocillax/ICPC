To run C++17 codes in Mac. Do the following: 
instead of using CodeRunner, write the following code in the terminal:

"clang++ --std=c++17 filename.cpp"

Then a file named "a.out" will be created. 

Then write the following code in the terminal:

"./a.out"


So basically for this repository, you will write the following:

clang++ --std=c++17 main.cpp
./a.out

N.B: Make sure you are in the right directory. input.txt will not work in this method. 

"Enjoy Coding!"

Exit();
